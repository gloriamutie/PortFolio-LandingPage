        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer with a wide range of experience providing creative solutions and excellent customer service through programming,
             design and administration of databases and applications. I am able to work independently, 
            as a team member or lead a team of developers. Experienced with Agile development.
            I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set,
             as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques that bring the best out of me.</p>
